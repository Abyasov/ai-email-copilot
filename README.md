# ai-email-copilot
AI Email Copilot - Chrome extension that helps you respond to emails using AI. Simply highlight the email text, click the icon, and describe in your native language how you want to respond. The AI assistant will generate a professional reply in the original language of correspondence.

Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model, this extension requires your OpenAI API key for operation. You'll be prompted to enter your API key during the first use - this ensures your data privacy and gives you full control over the API usage.

_Note: You'll need an OpenAI API key with GPT-4o access to use this extension. The key is stored locally in your browser and is never shared with third parties._
